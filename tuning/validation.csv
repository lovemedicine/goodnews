"Republican proposes making Trump’s birthday a public holiday. Claudia Tenney’s bill combining Flag Day with Trump’s birthday could face steep odds of success in Congress. A Republican congresswoman has proposed to make Donald Trump’s birthday a public holiday, in a bid likely doomed to failure in Congress but obviously intended to curry favor with the president. Claudia Tenney, a representative from New York’s Finger Lakes region, introduced legislation Friday aiming to combine the US annual commemoration of Flag Day with a new observance of Trump’s birthday on 14 June, arguing that the president is “the most consequential … in modern American history”",bad

"‘An unprecedented situation’: EPA plan for LA wildfire cleanup stirs protests over toxic dangers Demonstrators have protested against an expedited cleanup process that would involve using a beloved beach as a toxic waste sorting site.\n\nThis weekend, more than a hundred demonstrators protested against a new plan by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to use a local beach as a toxic waste sorting site, to process debris from the Palisades fire. They waved signs saying “Save Our Beaches” and “Sort Toxics at the Burn Site” as they walked up and down the path along Will Rogers state beach in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, just outside Los Angeles.\n\nTheir message? Wildfire debris isn’t just ash – it’s poison. “Asbestos, heavy metals, dioxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons will not remain contained,” a petition circulated by a local resident, Ashley Oelsen, says. “Toxic contaminants from the wildfire debris could leach into the soil and the waterways. Onshore winds will undoubtedly carry these hazardous particulates, compromising the air quality where people live, work and play. The risk to our ocean’s health is just as alarming.”",good

"Family Torn Apart as Mother & 2 Children Deported After Arizona Traffic Stop, 2 Other Kids Left Behind. An undocumented Venezuelan mother and two of her children were deported to Mexico earlier this month — just hours after a minor traffic stop, reports John Washington, who has covered the case for the Tucson-based independent outlet Arizona Luminaria. Arizona Public Safety troopers claimed the mother was driving under the speed limit. The mother, whom Democracy Now! is not identifying at the request of the family, described being handcuffed in front of her children, aged 6 and 9. The troopers called Border Patrol agents, who apprehended the woman and her two children and later turned them over to Mexican immigration officials in the border city of Nogales before they were put on a bus and driven about 2,000 miles away to the southern Mexican state of Tabasco. The woman suffered a “night of interrogation,” says Washington. The woman’s family was unable to reach the mother for days, until she was finally able to call her family letting them know of her whereabouts. Her two other children, who are 8 and 14 years old, are still in Tucson. We also speak with immigrant rights activist Greisa Martínez Rosas, executive director of United We Dream Action, who says Democrats share the blame for harmful immigration policies now reaching new heights under the Trump administration. “We need a true opposition power and party,” she says.",bad
