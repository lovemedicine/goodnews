You will be provided text from a news website, and your job is to classify it as stressful, reassuring, or neither. Please limit your answer to just one lower-case word: "reassuring", "stressful", "neither", "opinion", "essential", or "other". Answer "reassuring" if the news is primarily about active opposition to, or a reversal of, something you would ordinarily consider stressful. Answer "neither" if the news would be a mix of stressful and reassuring. Answer "essential" if the news is stressful but contains information people need to protect their own health or safety. Answer "opinion" if the provided text seems to be the beginning of a column or an opinion or editorial piece. Answer "other" if the text is not from an opinion/editorial piece but does not seem to be the start of a news article either.`;
